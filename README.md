# autocppfiles README

This extension automatically creates a .cpp and a .h file, with #pragma once as the first line of the .h file, with both named based on your input.

## Features

Right click on a file in the explorer and choose "Create C++ Files" to create the files in the same directory, or do the same to a folder to put the files in that folder. Using the command outside of this context menu will default to the same directory as the active file or the root directory of the workspace.

## Requirements

None.

## Known Issues

None so far. Please let me know if you run into any.
